## ⚡ Features
- Load and clean car sales dataset
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- Apply **feature engineering** (scaling, encoding, splitting)
- Train a **Random Forest Regressor** for prediction
- Evaluate using **MAE** and **R² Score**

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swathivengat/Car_Sales_Data-.git
   cd Car_Sales_Data-
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the analysis script:
```bash
python check.py
```

Expected output:
- First 5 rows of the dataset
- Model training performance (MAE, R² score)
- Any insights or graphs generated

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **File:** `car_sales_data.csv`
- Contains details about car sales such as brand, price, fuel type, horsepower, and more.
- Can be used for sales trend analysis and predictive modeling.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add visualization dashboards (Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly)
- Train multiple models for comparison
- Deploy as a simple web app with **Streamlit** or **Flask**
